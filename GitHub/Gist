## Gists

Gists are a GitHub feature for sharing small code snippets, notes, or files quickly without creating a full repository.

**What they are:**

- Lightweight repositories (yes, they're actually Git repositories under the hood)
- Designed for sharing individual files or small collections of files
- Can be public or secret (not private - important distinction)
- Each Gist gets its own URL
- Support version control - you can see edit history
- Can be forked, cloned, and embedded in web pages
- Support comments from other users

**Public vs Secret Gists:**

- **Public**: Discoverable, show up in search, appear on your profile
- **Secret**: Not discoverable or searchable, but NOT encrypted or truly private. Anyone with the URL can access it. Don't put passwords or sensitive data here.

**Common use cases:**

- Sharing code snippets in discussions or documentation
- Quick notes or to-do lists
- Configuration files you want to reference across machines
- Code examples for teaching or troubleshooting
- Embedding code snippets in blogs or websites

**What Gists are NOT:**

- Not a replacement for proper repositories with multiple collaborators
- Not secure storage (even secret Gists are accessible if someone has the link)
- Not meant for full projects with multiple directories and complex structure
