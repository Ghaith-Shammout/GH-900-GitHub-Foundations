## Repository
A repository (or "repo") is a directory or storage space where your project lives. It contains all of your project's files and the entire history of changes made to those files.
What's actually in a repository:

1. Your project files - code, documentation, images, whatever your project needs
2. The .git directory - hidden folder containing all version control metadata, commit history, branch information, configuration
3. Commit history - complete record of every change, who made it, when, and why

Two types you need to distinguish:
- **Local repository** - exists on your machine. You can commit, branch, and work entirely offline.
- **Remote repository** - exists on a server (like GitHub). Acts as the central source of truth for team collaboration.

Once your repo is initiated on GitHub, now you are ready to clone your repo. 

### Cloning
Cloning creates a local copy of a repository on your machine. You use the command 
```bash
git clone <url>
```

- Creates a complete copy with all history on your local system
- Maintains a connection to the original repository (called the "remote" or "origin")
- You can pull updates from the original and push changes back (if you have permissions)
- Happens between GitHub (remote) and your computer (local)
- No new repository is created on GitHub

### Forking
Forking creates a copy of a repository under your own GitHub account.

- Happens entirely on GitHub's servers
- Creates a separate repository that you own and control
- The fork maintains a relationship to the original (upstream) repository
- You have full permissions on your fork even if you had none on the original
- Used primarily for contributing to projects you don't have write access to

**The key difference:**

Clone = GitHub → Your computer (download)

Fork = GitHub → GitHub under your account (server-side copy)

**Typical workflow for contributing to open source:**
- Step 1 - Fork the repository on GitHub (now you have your own copy)
- Step 2 - Clone your fork to your local machine
- Step 3 - Make changes locally
- Step 4 - Push changes to your fork
- Step 5 - Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository
